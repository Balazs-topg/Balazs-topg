## Recent Projects

- **react-ripples-continued** *The material design ripple effect for react ⚛️ made simple yet customisable*
  
  I built this because I couldn't find a good and lightweight ripple effect library for react, so i though that i'd make my own
- **nar-slutar-lektionen** *A simple webapp for checking when the lesson ends ⏰*

  Built ontop of skola24s strange and undocumented API
- **poor-mans-react-js** *A simple recreation of React ⚛️*

  I built this to gain a deeper understanding of reacts inner workings
- **webshop** *A fully complete webshop 🛍️, also my gymnasiearbete (currently WIP)*

  My gymnasiearbete. (it's not finished yet)

## What's Next?
